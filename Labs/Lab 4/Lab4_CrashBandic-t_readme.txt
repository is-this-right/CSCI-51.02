Lab 4: Intro to Assembly I
Authors: Kirsten Chidrome, Alec Dayupay, Jose Siongco

Coverage:
* one-input multiplication. Multiply input to a given number
* two-input multiplication. Multiply inputs to one another.

Limitations:
* it is assumed that only VALID INTEGERS will be input into the program
** VALID INTEGERS is defined to be the a whole number (both positive and negative) without a decimal point or fraction
* floats, doubles, strings, booleans, and any other data type (or structs) are assumed to not be used as an input
* INTEGERS to be used are the primitive types natural to the C++ language in terms of size, number of bits, and implementation

Test Cases Covered to Prove Optimal Solution:
1. Uses shifts and adds only. Check S file as proof
2. Handles multiplication amongst positive integers
3. Handles multiplication amongst negative integers
4. Handles multiplication to zero
